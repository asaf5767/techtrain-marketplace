# Greeting Style Guide

## Knowledge
- Greetings should be warm but not informal ("Welcome" not "Hey there!")
- Always use the user's name when available
- Never use exclamation marks in greetings (calm professionalism)
- Keep greetings to one sentence maximum

## Workflow
1. Check if the text contains a user-facing greeting
2. Apply the greeting rules above
3. Keep the original meaning — just adjust the tone

## Verification
- Does the greeting sound professional?
- Is the user's name used when available?
- Are there zero exclamation marks in the greeting?
- Is the greeting one sentence or shorter?
